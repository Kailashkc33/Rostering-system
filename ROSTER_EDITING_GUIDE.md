# GrillTalk Roster Management - Admin Guide

## üéØ Overview
The roster management system allows administrators to create, edit, and manage staff schedules with full support for editing published rosters.

## üîß Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Roster Status Management
- **DRAFT**: Rosters that are still being worked on
- **PUBLISHED**: Live rosters that staff can see and clock into
- **ARCHIVED**: Past rosters for record keeping

### ‚úÖ Shift Editing for Published Rosters
Admins can now **edit shifts even after a roster is published**, with the following safeguards:

1. **Confirmation Prompt**: When editing published rosters, a warning appears asking for confirmation
2. **Visual Indicators**: Published rosters show a warning message that changes affect live schedules
3. **Success Messages**: Different messages for draft vs published roster edits

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Validation
- **Required Fields**: Staff, date, start time, and end time are all required
- **Time Logic**: End time must be after start time
- **Break Calculation**: Automatic break time calculation (30 min for shifts > 6 hours)

### ‚úÖ Roster Management Features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Published Roster Editing
- **Staff Impact**: Changes to published rosters immediately affect what staff see
- **Clock-in Impact**: If shifts are deleted or times changed, active clock-ins may be affected
- **Notification**: Consider notifying staff of schedule changes outside the system

### Time Handling
- All times are stored in UTC and displayed in local time
- Date/time combinations are properly validated
- Break times are automatically calculated

### Data Validation
- Start time must be before end time
- All required fields must be filled
- Staff must exist in the system
- Duplicate validation prevents conflicting schedules

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Staff not found"**: Ensure the staff member exists and isn't deleted
2. **"Invalid time"**: Check that end time is after start time
3. **"Cannot publish roster with no shifts"**: Add at least one shift before publishing
4. **"Roster for this week exists"**: When copying, ensure the target week doesn't already have a roster
